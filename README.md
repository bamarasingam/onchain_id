# Onchain_ID

## Bringing offchain identification onchain

### Steps of Implementation
The following are a rough guideline of the steps which will be taken in order too accomplish this. Granted, the roadmap is open too be changed as not 100% certain that this implementation in which we envision it will work completly.

- Develop live facial recognition
- Figure out a way too inscribe information from facial recognition into an NFT or SBT(Soulbound Token)
- Deploy a website too which a user can come, connect their wallet & camera, to which we've now recorded a unique identity for that person. Using their face again which another wallet should be flagged and not allowed as the goal is too only allow for 1 account per person.
- May implement further forms of identification, but will start with just facial recognition.

Will work with some EVM native chain (ex. Ethereum, Base, Optimism, etc.) 
Will build facial recognition model on Python using various libraries
